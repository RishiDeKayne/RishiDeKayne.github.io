I currently write for two different blogs:
- My own blog PhDetails thich you can find [Here](http://phdetails.blogspot.com) where I interview PhD students from across the world about their academic path and their experiences applying for and undertaking a PhD. To date I have interviewed over 100 students and hope to continue these interviews in 2021!

- The Molecular Ecologist blog that you can find [Here](http://https://www.molecularecologist.com/) where I hope to continue to interview more academics from a variety of career stages, write some basic tutorials on common population genetic analyses, and write articles about academic careers and exciting new research from evolutionary biology.
