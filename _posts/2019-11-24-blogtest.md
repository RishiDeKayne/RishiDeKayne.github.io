<p>I currently write for two different blogs:</p>

<p>My own blog <ins>PhDetails</ins> thich you can find [Here](http://phdetails.blogspot.com) where I interview PhD students from across the world about their academic path and their experiences applying for and undertaking a PhD. To date I have interviewed over 100 students and hope to continue these interviews in 2021!</p>

<p><ins>The Molecular Ecologist blog</ins> that you can find [Here](http://https://www.molecularecologist.com/) where I hope to continue to interview more academics from a variety of career stages, write some basic tutorials on common population genetic analyses, and write articles about academic careers and exciting new research from evolutionary biology. </p>
