			<h1>The PhDetails Blog</h1>
			
			<p>I started the PhDetails blog as a place to find out about, and share, the ups and downs, ins and outs and stories behind biology PhD students from all over the world. I hope to remove some of the mystique surrounding PhDs and give a real insight into what a variety different PhD students did to end up where they are, what they're currently doing with their time, and what drives them.</p>
			<p>Recently, I have also been writing articles on a variety of subjects including aspects of the academic process as well as more practical tutorials for undertaking bioinformatics projects.</p>
			<p>You can find the <ins>PhDetails</ins> blog <a href="http://phdetails.blogspot.com">HERE</a>. To date I have interviewed over 100 students and hope to continue these interviews in 2021!</p>

			<p>I hope PhDetails not only acts as some therapy for current PhD students but also can shows undergrads and masters students that there are many different paths leading to a PhD (and even more to finishing one).</p>

			<p>I have also contributed to <ins>The Molecular Ecologist blog</ins>, which you can find <a href="https://www.molecularecologist.com">HERE</a></p>
