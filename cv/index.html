			<p>My research interests are mainly linked to the genomic patterns underpinning adaptation and speciation. My PhD project will focus on understanding genomic divergence between members of the diverse Swiss whitefish radiation (Coregonus lavaretus complex). Specifically I hope to identify differences in divergence patterns, trait architecture and genome structure within this radiation to better understand the genomic basis of speciation.</p>
