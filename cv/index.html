			<p>My research interests are mainly linked to the genomic patterns underpinning adaptation and speciation. My PhD project will focus on understanding genomic divergence between members of the diverse Swiss whitefish radiation (Coregonus lavaretus complex). Specifically I hope to identify differences in divergence patterns, trait architecture and genome structure within this radiation to better understand the genomic basis of speciation.</p>
			<p>The first part of my project has involved the production of a linkage map for whitefish using F1 offspring from two wild-caught C. sp. "Albock" individuals from lake Thun. The map was produced using a RAD-seq approach and the linkage mapping software Lep-MAP3 resulting in both sex-specific and sex-averaged maps containing ~6000 SNP loci. I have also started the assembly of the whitefish genome, which, being large (~4Gb) and still residually tetraploid, poses many challenges. The approach we have taken for the assembly is to carry out ~60x PacBio sequencing and use the assembler Canu to optimize both assembly quality and computational efficiency.</p>
