			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>My research interests are mainly related to the genomic patterns underpinning adaptation and speciation and I currently do my PhD at Eawag and the University of Bern in Switzerland under the supervision of Philine Feulner and Ole Seehausen. My PhD project is focussed on understanding genomic divergence between members of the diverse Swiss whitefish radiation (<em>Coregonus lavaretus</em> species complex). Specifically I hope to identify differences patterns of divergence, trait architecture and genome structure between ecologically different sympatric whitefish species within the radiation and compare and contrast these patterns with the differences between ecologically similar allopatric species from different lake systems.</p>
			<p>The first part of my project involved the production of a linkage map for Alpine whitefish using F1 offspring from two wild-caught <em>C. sp. "Albock"</em> individuals from lake Thun. The map was produced using a RAD-seq approach and the linkage mapping software Lep-MAP3 resulting in both sex-specific and sex-averaged maps containing ~6000 SNP loci. (the resulting paper can be found <a href="https://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/8/12/3745.full.pdf">HERE</a>)</p>

			<p>For the second chapter of my project I assembled the Alpine whitefish genome, which, being large and still residually tetraploid, posed many challenges. We carried out ~90x PacBio sequencing and then used three assemblers: Falcon, Canu and wtdbg2. After Hi-C scaffolding, each of the assembles was of high quality and each included >90% BUSCOs. The best assembly was determined to be that from wtdbg2 which I then went on to annotate using MAKER2. (A preprint of our Alpine whitefish genome paper can be found <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/09/16/771600.full.pdf">HERE</a>)</p>

			<p>I am now working on whole-genome resequencing data from 96 samples across the Alpine whitefish radiation. We have sequenced three individuals of each of the species from each lake with a radiation to around 20x coverage. I now aim to understand how these whitefish species are related to one another, the extent of gene flow across the radiation and determine the genetic basis and possible parallelism in key ecological traits.</p>
